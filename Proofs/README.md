# Proofs Directory Overview

This directory contains verifiable records supporting the Closed-Logic Archival Integrity (CLTPM).  
Each file corresponds to one verification layer:

- **ArDrive_TXID.txt** → Blockchain permanence  
- **SHA256.txt** → File checksum integrity  
- **Archival_Integrity_Report** → Cross-validation record  
- **Technical_Remark** → GPT-5 logical audit remark  
- **Closed-Logic_Audit_Certificate** → Formal logic closure certification  
- **Release_Notes** → Version disclosure for V1.0  
- **Draft_Lineage** → Chronological record of pre-publication drafts (DOI + SHA-256 + private TXID)

> The file `Draft_Lineage.md` documents the **chronological evolution of ACT drafts (V0.9 → V1.2)**  
> prior to the public release of *Alzheimer’s Choice Theory V1.0 Final Draft (ZH)*.  
> It includes verifiable DOIs and SHA-256 checksums, with blockchain TXIDs retained privately  
> for security under the Closed-Logic Theoretical Preservation Model (CLTPM).
