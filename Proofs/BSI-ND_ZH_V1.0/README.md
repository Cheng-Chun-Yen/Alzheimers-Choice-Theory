# ACT — BSI-ND Semantic Protection (ZH V1.0)

This folder contains the complete **semantic-protection package** for  
**Part I — BSI-ND (Brain–Self Integrity under Non-Degeneration)**  
within the *Alzheimer’s Choice Theory (ACT)* closed-causal framework.

All files correspond to the officially released version archived at  
[Zenodo DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17499355](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17499355).

## 🔒 Purpose

This release ensures that **Part I (BSI-ND)** of ACT retains immutable authorship,  
causal closure, and semantic-layer traceability.  
Each document serves a distinct verification or protection role in the  
**Closed-Logic Theoretical Preservation Model (CLTPM)**.

## 🧩 Version Stability Clause

Textual content of the semantic-protection files is immutable as of V1.0.  
Future updates may add metadata (e.g., TXID, DOI, mirror links) without changing any closed causal assertion.  
All documents within this set are subject to **causal invariance** and **semantic immutability** under ACT.
