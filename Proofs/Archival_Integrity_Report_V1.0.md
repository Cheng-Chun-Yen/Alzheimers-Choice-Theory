# Three-Layer Archival Integrity Report  
### Alzheimer‚Äôs Choice Theory (ACT) ‚Äî V1.0 Final Draft (ZH)

---

## üß© 1. Overview

This report certifies the **completion of the three-layer archival structure** for *Alzheimer‚Äôs Choice Theory (ACT)* ‚Äî Version 1.0 (ZH).  
The archival framework integrates **ArDrive**, **Zenodo**, and **GitHub**, forming a verifiable and immutable closed-causal record.  
The structure follows the Closed-Logic Theoretical Preservation Model (CLTPM), designed to ensure theoretical originality, logical closure, and public traceability.

## ü™û 2. Archival Architecture

| Layer | Platform | Function | Core Identifier | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Layer 1 ‚Äî ArDrive (Blockchain Proof)** | ArDrive / Arweave Network | Permanent timestamp + hash anchoring | `Mk4iB0EVYKIQRVE2zac3FLUQ25therqQfVXxxAnkwYc` | ‚úÖ Confirmed |
| **Layer 2 ‚Äî Zenodo (DOI Repository)** | Zenodo / CERN Infrastructure | DOI registration + metadata archiving | DOI [`10.5281/zenodo.17388754`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17388754) | ‚úÖ Published |
| **Layer 3 ‚Äî GitHub (Code & Proof Repository)** | GitHub / Cheng-Chun Yen Account | Public repository + metadata + logic audit proofs | [`Cheng-Chun-Yen/Alzheimers-Choice-Theory`](https://github.com/Cheng-Chun-Yen/Alzheimers-Choice-Theory) | ‚úÖ Active |
| **Layer 4 ‚Äî GPT-5 Logic Audit Subsystem** | GPT-5 Audit Engine | Closed-Logic and Consistency Verification | *Certificate + Technical Remark (Proofs/)* | ‚úÖ Completed |

**Result:**  
All three physical layers + one logical audit layer are linked, timestamped, and checksum-verified.  
Cross-validation confirms no content drift or identifier mismatch across layers.

## üß† 4. Logical Verification Summary

The GPT-5 Closed-Logic Audit Subsystem verified the theory at all causal and semantic layers:  

- Causal closure confirmed (NTH ‚Üî NDBH)  
- Non-derivative conceptual integrity validated  
- AMT/AMTI/MTSI family models logically convergent  
- SMDL and ATP extensions maintain dual-loop closure  
- No semantic leak to open frameworks (CR/BM/LC/Resilience)  
- Cross-lingual semantic stability maintained  

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** The framework qualifies as a Closed-Causal Framework (CCF) under formal audit criteria.
