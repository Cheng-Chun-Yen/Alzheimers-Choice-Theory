# Closed-Logic Theoretical Preservation Model (CLTPM)

This document provides an overview of the **Closed-Logic Theoretical Preservation Model (CLTPM)** —  
the verification architecture used to ensure cross-platform archival integrity for the  
_Alzheimer’s Choice Theory (ACT)_ repository.

All verification data and machine-readable proofs are stored in the  
[`.verifications/`](./.verifications/) directory.

Key reference:
- [`integrity_index.md`](./.verifications/integrity_index.md) — Full CLTPM structure and cross-system mapping  
  (Zenodo DOI → ArDrive TXID → GitHub SHA256 → JSON Proofs Index).

This file serves as the conceptual entry point for CLTPM in external archives (e.g., Zenodo).
